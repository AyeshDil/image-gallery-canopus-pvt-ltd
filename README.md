Image gallery application using the CodeIgniter framework

##Image Gallery Project Summary
This is a simple image gallery application developed using the CodeIgniter framework. The application allows users to upload images to the server and view them on a home page. The images are stored in a MySQL database.
The home page of the application displays all the uploaded images in a grid layout using the Bootstrap framework. Users can also search for images by caption or tags using a search bar and search button.
The application features pagination to improve performance when displaying large numbers of images. The pagination feature allows users to browse through the images in a controlled manner, with each page displaying a limited number of images.
The image upload feature of the application allows users to select multiple images at once and upload them to the server. The uploaded images are automatically resized and optimized for display on the home page using the GD library.
The application also includes a simple user authentication system that requires users to log in before they can upload images. The authentication system is implemented using the CodeIgniter built-in session library.
Overall, this application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for uploading, displaying, and searching for images in a web-based gallery.
